# code-examples
The repository contains some of the most representative/interesting individual modules from the most recent project, which have been authored by Andrew Yurkiv.
Please note that this code has not been _polished_ to make an impression, but rather displays a result of a casual real-world work: a result of a constant time pressure, never-ending product area edits etc - as close to the everyday regular code quality as possible.
